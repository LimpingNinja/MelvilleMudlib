The various critical system objects are stored here, including the driver
object, the auto object, and the user and player objects. Also here are
special daemon objects like the user daemon and the soul daemon. This
directory has some special privileges and you should be very careful
about making changes here, or adding new objects to this directory,
especially if those objects read or write files.
