These files are included by auto.c (NOT inherited: you can't inherit into
the auto object, since all objects inherit it.) overrides.c defines functions
which override several kfuns to provide security and protect them against
improper use. security.c defines various security-related functions that
either control object privileges or use them to allow or deny access to
the overridden kfuns.
