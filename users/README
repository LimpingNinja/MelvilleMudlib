This directory stores the home directories of wizards, which have the
name of the wizard in question. Thus, Mobydick's home directory is
/users/mobydick. Note that it is not /users/m/mobydick: you may need
to add some subdirectory structure if you have many wizards.
The character ~ will generally be resolved to the home directory of
this_user().
Note also that an object loaded from a wizard's home directory does not
have the same privileges as the wizard's body does. Notably, it will
generally be unable to read and write files. This is especially
important for admin home directories.
