This directory contains the start room of the mud world and any other
rooms or objects you might want to connect to the start room. If your
mud world is small you can keep all the files in this directory. If it
is larger, you may need to add a subdirectory structure, or link the
rooms in this directory to rooms in wizards' directories, or create
some yet fancier structure.
