The latest version of the Melville mudlib is stored in this directory.

Melville is a mudlib written by Stephen Schmidt (Mobydick) for the DGD
driver. It is a small starter mudlib which you can use to organize a
group of wizards for your own coding projects. It has a working mail
system, bulletin board, channel daemon, and room system so that you can
communicate as a group, a player/wizard/admin hierarchy of wizards to
organize code access, and support for most traditional LP features like
object inventories, command paths, object-defined commands, emotes and
soul commands, and so forth. It does not have any game features such as
combat, magic, races, or levels. This makes the mudlib more suitable
for non-game applications as well as leaving you free to implement any
game features you want in your own fashion. It has 51 commands,
23 for players and the rest for wizards or admins.

The current version of the lib, 0.9.1, takes up 89k compressed and will
uncompress to 399k; it contains 142 files. It unpacks to a single directory
calld melville which contains all of the code and supporting documentation.
To use it, you need to download and compile the DGD driver, which is probably
available on the same site as this. Version 0.9.1 of Melville should work
with version 1.2 of DGD. Melville does not run over the kernel lib and 
you can remove the kernel mudlib if you wish to run Melville (or you can
keep the kernel in a separate directory, and have both).
