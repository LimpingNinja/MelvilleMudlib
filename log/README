All logs generated by the driver or mudlib are stored in this directory.
The log_file autofun is used to give special privileges to the user object
so that it may write here.

If you redirect the driver process's output or error spool, you might want
to redirect those into this directory as well: although if you do that you
must not rm those files without shutting down first since otherwise the
file pointers from the driver process will be corrupted.
