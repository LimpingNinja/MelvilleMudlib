This file describes the soul command data file, its current entries, and
the method for adding new commands to the soul daemon.
The soul daemon is /system/soul_d.c. At create time it reads the possible
soul commands from the file /data/system/soul.data. The currently accessible
commands are:

smile, bow, wave, frown, curtsey, scream, faint, groan, kick, ponder,
meditate, cheer, nod, grin, shrug, giggle, sigh, boogie

Each command takes up three lines in the data file. The first is the
command word that the user types to invoke this soul command. The
second is the message printed to the user. The third is the message
printed to other users in the same room, except that $N will be replaced
by the user's name. Any string the user types after the soul command
will be appended to the messages. Thus, if the soul entry is:

gag
You gag on a spoon
$N gags
 
and the user types

"gag joyfully"

then the printed messages will be:

"You gag on a spoon joyfully."
"Mobydick gags joyfully."

To add your own soul commands, just add the relevant three lines to
the data file. Then -recreate- the soul daemon with the recreate
command. Updating it alone won't add your new commands, because
update (unlike on other LPs) only changes the code, but leaves
the internal data unchanged. Recreate dests the object and reloads
it, and then create() will be invoked to load the new data. (Or,
if you haven't changed the code, just invoke create() in the
soul daemon some other way without bothering to update it.)
