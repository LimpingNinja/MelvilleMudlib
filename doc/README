All the documentation that comes with the mudlib goes here (except for the
comments in the various files, naturally). You may also want to simlink
your kfun docs that came with the driver to this directory.
If there's any files in here you haven't read, you should do so: they're
very informative and there aren't so many that you can't get through them
all fairly quickly.
