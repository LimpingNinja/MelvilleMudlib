The directory structure of the Melville mudlib is based on ten root
level directories, described below.

/cmds holds the command bins called by player.c. /cmds/player holds the
player commands, /cmds/wizard holds the wizard commands, and /cmds/admin
holds the admin commands.

/data holds various data files. /data/user and /data/player hold the
save files for users and players respectively. /data/system holds files
needed by system objects, for example the soul daemon's data file of
soul commands. /data/mail (will hold) user mail spools.

/doc holds the various documents that describe the way the mudlib works
and the functions the objects define. You may want to simlink your kfun
docs into this directory too.

/inherit holds files meant to be inherited by many different files, for
example object.c, room.c, container.c, and board.c.

/include holds the include files used for mudlib defines.

/log holds any log files generated by the driver or mudlib.

/obj holds simple example objects.

/system holds various important mudlib objects like the auto object,
the driver object, and the user and player objects. It also contains
some administrative daemons like user_d.c, and the soul daemon.

/users contains the home directories of the wizards.

/world contains the rooms of the mud and the objects that are cloned
into those rooms.
